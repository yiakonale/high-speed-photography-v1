# High Speed Photography Unit V1

The problem with capturing high-speed photos boils down to how fast the camera can sample the subject. In nearly all cameras digital or analog, it comes down to the shutter speed. The shutter speed dictates how long the sensor (analog or digital) is exposed for, and therefore the "speed" of the photo. Regular digital cameras can expose a photo to 1/250 or 1/500 of a second. The fastest camera I own is an SLR with a mechanical shutter that can do 1/4000 of a second, which means that the film is exposed for 250us. One can optimize for faster and faster shutter speeds but the next bottleneck becomes the sensor itself. The less time you expose for, the less light the sensor can absorb. You can optimize for maximum light sensitivity but that's when the cost also skyrockets.

One workaround to this, is instead of relying on an ultra-fast shutter for quick exposure, instead using an ultra-fast light source to expose the event. The camera is set up to take a long exposure with large aperture and in complete darkness. When the event is you wish to capture takes place, the light source is triggered and exposes the scene for a very short instant. This works in the reverse way as before, as we now control the light source and leave the shutter wide open. The advantage to doing this is that you can use any regular camera, so long as you can take a long exposure. In order to know when you should pulse the light source, you need a way of knowing when your event is taking place, and very quickly triggerring a flash of light. A good video explanation of this concept can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-4pbFcERnk).

A reliable way of quickly detecting when to trigger the light source is to use acoustic waves or sound. The only downside to this is that the event itself has to produce some kind of noise or sound at the instant we wish to capture. Fortunately, there are many such events that produce a noise such as a balloon pop, champagne popping, things smashing into other objects, etc.
To capture a clean photo an event, we need to produce a pulse of light to expose the scene. The difficulty is creating a flash which is both bright enough and short enough to not cause blurring. Fortunately modern camera flashes are more than capable of producing sharp, bright flashes in an instant. Such flashtubes commonly contain high-pressure xenon gas in a sealed glass tube that get ionized by a pulse of high-voltage, momentarily allowing a large amount of current to flow through the tube which creates the bright flash. The gas can be ionized by wrapping a coil of wire around the glass tube and pulsing high-voltage. The high-voltage can capacitively couple through the gas and create plasma. The ends of the flashtube are also connected to a high voltage DC source, usually a capacitor. When the plasma is initially created, the strong electric field inside the tube accelerates the charged particles, creating a cascading avalanche effect until all or most of the gas is ionized. Once a low impedance connection is established through the plasma, the capacitor can rapidly discharge through the glass, heating it in the process and creating a bright flash of light.

To make this work, we need 3 main components. The first is a sound detector that can sense changes in air pressure that will generate the signal for the light to flash. We want this to be sensitive enough to detect sounds from a few meters distance, but not too sensitive to avoid accidental misfires. Something adjustable would be ideal. The second is a trigger circuit that can ionize the flashtube when the signal is sent by the detector. A trigger transformer in combination with an electronic switch is often used to create the HV pulse. I salvaged the trigger transformer, high-voltage capacitor as well as the flashtube from an old digital camera, though I've also seen them being used in wall mounted fire alarm sirens like [this one](https://www.shutterstock.com/video/clip-10242920-fire-alarm-emergency-flashing-light) as these use a similar circuit. You can actually just make out the coil of wire around the flashlamp in the center. You can also buy the entire circuit on [Ebay](https://www.ebay.ca/itm/125804677365). Lastly, we'll need a step-up converter to charge our capacitor, usually in the range of 300-400V and a few tens of microfarads.

I decided to design 3 PCBs, one for each subcircuit and then connect them together somehow. Not a lot of thought went into this phase as will be evident later on. The trigger circuit is really simple. It consists of an electronic switch, in this case a thyristor that can safely control the high-voltage pulse. I've also seen this being done with IGBTs but thyristors are easier to find for this application. To create the high voltage pulse, we need a high turn-ratio transformer, as well as a series capacitor. This small capacitor slowly charges through a resistor and rapidly discharges through the primary of the transformer, creating a high voltage spark on the output, similar to an electrostatic discharge. This is enough to break down the gas inside the tube.
